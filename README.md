# Docker, NGINX, PHP 7.4.x, Symfony 5.x and MySQL (almost) from scratch!

So yes, I'm back to the stack I thought I would never work with again. But this time I want to "dockerize" it and use 
the last current versions. And well, I'm back to Windows, even with the brand new WSL2! 

Everything may change in a little while.

However, I'll try to work some more mature architecture or... Whatever, just master this tech stack.

## Current goals:

### Infrastructure goals:
- [ ] Use docker (in my case, for Windows)
- [ ] Use Last NGINX version on docker
- [ ] Use Last PHP version on docker
- [ ] Use last Symfony version on the PHP container
- [ ] Use some MySQL-like database (MariaDB, Percona, Oracle) on Docker
- [ ] Use RabbitMQ on Docker
- [ ] MAYBE use some caching mechanism (Redis?)
- [ ] MAYBE fool around with Elasticsearch and Kibana

### Architectural goals
- [ ] Create a simple SPA Web Application

### Development goals 
- [ ] Use a Jetbrains IDE to develop on the containers  
- [ ] Be able to debug directly on the IDE

### Academic goals:
- [ ] Use this environment to finish several online courses to help me master infrastructure and architectural goals
